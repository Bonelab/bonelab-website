Chloe is a visiting graduate student with the University of Waterloo and is co-supervised by former 
postdoctoral fellow, Dr. Nikolas Knowles. Her current research is focused on estimating bone 
stiffness in the proximal humerus in patients who have undergone stemless shoulder arthroplasty 
for end-stage osteoarthritis. After her Masters, she intends on furthering her education by 
attending medical school, with a desire to pursue radiology.
 
Outside of academics, Chloe loves to travel and has lived in 4 countries. She is a lifelong 
ballet dancer, baked goods connoisseur, and board game enthusiast.
