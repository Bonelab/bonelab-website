Chloe was a visiting graduate student with the University of Waterloo and was co-supervised by former 
postdoctoral fellow, Dr. Nikolas Knowles. Her research was focused on estimating bone 
stiffness in the proximal humerus in patients who have undergone stemless shoulder arthroplasty 
for end-stage osteoarthritis. After her Masters, she has started a PhD at the University of Alberta.

Outside of academics, Chloe loves to travel and has lived in 4 countries. She is a lifelong 
ballet dancer, baked goods connoisseur, and board game enthusiast.

Her MSc thesis title was "Validating internal density calibration in the proximal humerus to estimate bone stiffness using finite element analysis for stemless shoulder arthroplasty"
