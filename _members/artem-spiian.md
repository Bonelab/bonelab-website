Artem just finished high school in Ukraine and is currently in his 
first year at the medical university, Ukraine. However, he plans to 
enrol at the University of Calgary in Biomedical Engineering due to his interest 
in bioengineering. In his spare time he likes cycling, climbing and hiking.
His project is assessing bone microarchitecture in a population-based 
study called the Calgary Bone Health Study (CaBHS).
