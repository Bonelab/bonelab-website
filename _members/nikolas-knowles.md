Nik's interest is in non-invasive bone mechanics and he continues the work he did on 
upper extremities (shoulder) that combined finite element analysis with medical imaging 
data to study individuals with acute ACL-injury at increased risk for development of post-traumatic osteoarthritis.
In 2022 Nik left to become an Assistant Professor at the University of Waterloo.
