Armaan is a senior software engineering student with a biomedical engineering minor at the University of Calgary. 
Armaanâ€™s research focuses on predicting the risk of fragility fractures using first & second generation 
high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-PQCT) which provides an overview of bone 
density and bone microarchitecture. Using these outcomes and machine learning methods, the goal is to 
improve the prediction of fractures. He has been a summer student in 2021 and 2022.
