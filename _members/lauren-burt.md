Lauren uses high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) to explore the skeletal changes associated 
with ageing, sports participation and vitamin D supplementation. Lauren is working with the Canadian Multicentre Osteoporosis 
Study (CaMos), the Vitamin D Study and in a new project with the Canadian Sport Institute to explore bone strength and 
micro-architecture changes in figure skaters and other elite athletes.
