I’m interested in using imaging-based approaches to understand how the 
skeleton’s response to metabolic and mechanical challenges influences 
long-term bone health. My PhD thesis investigated pregnancy- and lactation-associated 
changes in maternal bone and identified adaptations that preserve 
mechanical function. My current research uses multimodal imaging to 
evaluate skeletal responses to midfoot stress fractures and acute knee 
injury. I’m focusing on evaluating microstructural changes after stress 
fracture and developing dual energy CT-based methods to image injury-associated bone marrow edema.
In 2021 Chantal started work at Invicro (https://invicro.com) in Boston, USA.
