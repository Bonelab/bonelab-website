Laura holds a B.Sc in Physics and a M.Sc. in Biomedical Physics from the University of Naples Federico II. 
She is enrolled in the SPACE Ph.D. program at Scuola Superiore Meridionale (UniNa), where she is focusing 
on the development of a spectral quantitative CT scan based on the use of photon counting hybrid pixel 
detectors. This new CT is being developed with the specific aim of performing bone densitometry in astronauts 
and patients suffering from bone metabolic diseases.
Laura visited the Bone Research Lab to learn about the HR-pQCT imaging technique and to build and 
validate simulation software.
