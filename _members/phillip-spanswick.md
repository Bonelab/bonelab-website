My research focuses on distal radius fractures (wrist fractures). 
My thesis utilizes HR-pQCT imaging and finite element analysis to measure bone strength 
following a fracture. Combining clinical measures of wrist function, disability, 
and pain, I aim to guide individualized treatment.

I did the Medical Imaging Specialization during my MSc training.
