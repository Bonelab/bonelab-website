Nina is studying bone changes in acute knee injuries. Before starting as a 
graduate student in the lab she worked as a study coordinator in the Bone Imaging 
Lab for the SALTACII and ZAPOA studies, so she is well suited for this transition. 
She is a recent Biomechanics graduate from the University of Calgary and 
is very excited to join the Bone Imaging Lab as a graduate student.
Outside the lab, Nina is a rhythmic gymnastics coach and judge.
