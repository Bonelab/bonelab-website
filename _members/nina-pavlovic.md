Nina studied bone changes in acute knee injuries. Before starting as a 
graduate student in the lab she worked as a study coordinator in the Bone Imaging 
Lab for the SALTACII and ZAPOA studies, so she was well suited for this transition. 
She has an undergraduate degree in Biomechanics from the University of Calgary.
Outside the lab, Nina is a rhythmic gymnastics coach and judge.

Her MSc thesis was titled: Localizing longitudinal changes in volumetric bone mineral 
density after acute knee injury using voxel-based morphometry
