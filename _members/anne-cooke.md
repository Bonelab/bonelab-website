I support research by providing imaging services, which includes caring and maintaining our equipment, 
developing imaging protocols and procedures, collecting data by scanning study participants, 
performing analysis and overseeingÂ Occupational Health & Safety (OH&S) requirements for the lab. 
I work on projects that require me to travel to NASA's Johnson Space Center regularly.
