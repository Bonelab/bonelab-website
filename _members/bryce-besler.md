I work on osteoporosis by building mathematical models from image data. I specialize in signal processing, 
partial differential equations, and software systems. How does one screen for people at risk of fracture? 
How does one predict bone microarchitecture? These ideas connect at a level of mathematical modelling of 
surface. My free time is occupied by ballroom, latin, and country dancing.

Dissertation title is "Bone as an Orientable, Smooth Surface: Distance Transforms, Morphometry, and Adaptation".
