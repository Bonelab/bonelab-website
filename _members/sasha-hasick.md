Sasha was a summer student visiting from the Western University in 2023 and 
returned for graduate studies in 2025. Her summer work focused on quantifying 
the precision of a novel algorithm used for analysis of knee morphology using HR-pQCT. 

Sasha's graduate project is focused on learning how an acute ACL injury affects 
long-term development of osteoarthritis by using multi-modal imaging.
