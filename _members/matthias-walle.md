Matthias holds a B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering from the Technical University of Munich, 
specializing in computational biomechanics. In 2023 he completed his Ph.D. at ETH Zürich 
on research that focuses on developing CT-based imaging and computational methods to investigate 
bone health. Specifically, he aims to understand how mechanical stimuli contribute to bone health 
and to identify potential biomarkers that can be utilized to monitor adverse changes in bone structure 
and strength caused by metabolic bone conditions, including Diabetes mellitus.

Matthias' work at the Bone Imaging Lab explores how disease affects bone remodelling as well as microgravity from space flight.
