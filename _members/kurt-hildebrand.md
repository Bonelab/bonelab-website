Investigating HR-pQCT feasibility as a medical imaging modality for assessing both bone and muscle. 
HR-pQCT has been the main method for assessing bone at distal limb sites, but there is currently 
no medical imaging modality that can assess muscle and bone. Our study is assessing whether 
HR-pQCT can fill this need for one imaging modality to scan for both bone and muscle.
