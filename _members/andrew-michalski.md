Andrew’s research interests focus on quantitative musculoskeletal imaging; 
his research addresses how we can use clinical imaging to answer MSK research 
questions through image processing and image-based finite element modeling. 
Andrew’s current work focuses on the secondary analysis of clinically acquired 
abdominal CT scans for osteoporosis opportunistic screening at the lumbar spine and hip.
Thesis title: A quantitative computed tomography approach towards opportunistic osteoporosis screening
Andy is now working at Calyx (https://www.calyx.ai/solutions/medical-imaging/).
