Claire was a summer student in the lab after graduating highschool and shortly before becoming a first year 
undergraduate student at the University of California, Los Angeles. Her first summer research focused
in the area of osteoporosis and bone health, specifically investigating the range of spinal MSK health issues
in a cohort of 4000 CT scans from our healthcare system. Her second summer research project continues that work
but now focuses on identifying vertebral fractures and comparing CT to DXA.
