Laura holds a B.Sc in Physics and a M.Sc. in Biomedical Physics from the University of Naples Federico II. She is enrolled in the SPACE Ph.D. program at Scuola Superiore Meridionale (UniNa), where she is focusing on the development of a spectral quantitative CT scan based on the use of photon counting hybrid pixel detectors. This new CT is being developed with the specific aim of performing bone densitometry in astronauts and patients suffering from bone metabolic diseases.
Laura visited the Bone Research Lab to learn about the HR-pQCT imaging technique and to build and validate simulation software.
