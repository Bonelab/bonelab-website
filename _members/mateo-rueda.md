Mateo is an undergraduate student studying mechanical engineering at the University of Calgary 
with a minor in biomedical engineering specializing in imaging techniques and computational simulations.

In 2022, his project was the application of the voidspace analysis protocol to knee images and 
afterwards analyzing longitudinal changes in voidspace prevalence and spatial distribution 
within trabecular bone tissue. Data is collected using advanced imaging techniques, including HR-pQCT.

In 2024, his project focuses on asynchronous calibration protocols for CT imaging and developing 
image processing methods to extract quantitative data from CT images.
