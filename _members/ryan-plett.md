My research has been focused on using the finite element (FE) method and HR-pQCT 
(get used to that acronym) to estimate bone strength at the distal radius. 
My research is testing whether 3D image registration can improve the precision 
of longitudinal bone strength estimates.
In March 2021, Ryan began working for Kinetyx Sciences Inc as a Test Engineer.
