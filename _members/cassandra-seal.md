As a part of her high schoolâ€™s Applied Science Program, Cassandra first 
joined with the lab to study the effects of various exercises on cortical 
and trabecular bone parameters using second-generation HR-pQCT. The 
following summer, she returned as a HYRS student to investigate the 
potential role of zoledronic acid in addressing early bone changes 
associated with ACL injuries.
