Danielle’s research utilizes high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-PQCT) to 
characterize changes in bone microarchitecture due to aging, disease progression (primarily osteoporosis), 
and fracture healing. Danielle’s thesis project focuses on coupling HR-pQCT with finite element modeling, 
and machine learning methods to improve predicition of who is at risk of having fragility fractures due by osteoporosis.
Danielle's dissertation is titled "The assessment of fragility fracture risk using HR-pQCT as a novel tool for diagnosis of osteoporosis". She
also completed the Medical Imaging Specialization.
In 2021, Danielle started her postdoctoral fellowship at the ETH Zürich, Switzerland with Dr. Ralph Müller (https://hest.ethz.ch/en).
She has now completed that and is a faculty member at the University of Calgary.
