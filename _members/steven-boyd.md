Dr. Steven Boyd, PhD, is a Professor, Department of Radiology in the Cumming School of Medicine 
at the University of Calgary and former (2016-2023) Director of the McCaig Institute for Bone and 
Joint Health. He is a Biomedical Engineer with a joint appointment in the Schulich School of Engineering. 

You can visit his university web page <a href="https://ucalgary.ca/people/steven-boyd" target="_blank">here</a>.

Dr. Boyd’s research focuses on understanding the aetiology of bone and joint diseases, with a 
particular interest in interventions targeting osteoporotic fracture prevention and altering the 
trajectory of post-traumatic osteoarthritis following an acute knee ligament injury. His work 
develops and applies novel high-resolution imaging techniques and computational approaches, 
and he has established a vibrant research team consisting of a senior scientist, post-doctoral 
fellows, MSc and PhD graduate students, undergraduate students and full-time staff based at his 
Bone Imaging Laboratory. He has published over 240 peer-reviewed manuscripts, 7 book chapters and 
has an H-index (Scopus, 2024) of 53 with over 13,000 citations. Recent publications include work 
in the area of vitamin D supplementation (JAMA), opportunistic CT (Med Eng Phys), post-traumatic 
osteoarthritis (J Orthop Res), image-based finite element analysis (J Biomech), contrast-enhanced 
imaging (J Clin Densitom) and fracture prediction in a longitudinal cohort study of bone health (J Bone Miner Res).

In 2016, he established the Centre for Mobility and Joint Health (MoJo), which serves as a hub 
for numerous clinical studies by many PIs at the University of Calgary and beyond in the area of 
bone and joint research and other areas of biomedical research. He was appointed a Fellow of the 
American Society of Bone and Mineral Research in 2018, and he holds the Bob and Nola Rintoul 
Chair in Bone and Joint Research. His research is 
supported by CIHR, NSERC, The Arthritis Society, Canadian Space Agency, Canada Foundation for 
Innovation, NIH collaborations and industry.
