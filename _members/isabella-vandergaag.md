Isabella completed her undergraduate with a chemical engineering major. Isabella has returned to the bone lab 
and her research project explores the relationship between joint alignment and joint spacing on 
predicting quality of life outcomes in people who have suffered an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury of the knee. 
She wants to know what risk factors are associated with worsened outcomes and subsequent development of osteoarthritis.
Thesis title: Does anatomical alignment and joint spacing predict QoL outcomes in ACL tear patients? She graduated in November 2023.
Notably, Isabella got her start as a summer student in the lab in 2018 and again in 2020 before completing her MSc in 2023.
