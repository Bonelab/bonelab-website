Nathan is an engineer with a background in fluid dynamics and numerical modelling. His research uses data from 
advanced imaging techniques, including HR-pQCT, to investigate the connection between acute knee injuries and 
the development of post-traumatic degenerative joint disease such as knee osteoarthritis.

Dissertation title: Development of automated methods for quantitative analysis of bone with high-resolution peripheral
computed tomography and application to investigate bone changes following ACL injury
