Kirsten’s interest is in opportunistic computed tomography analysis to assess muscle and 
bone loss in ICU patients. She plans to optimize this technique to explore the muscle-bone 
relationship utilizing clinically acquired scans.

Kirsten was supervised by Dr. Sarah Manske, and co-supervised by Dr. Steven Boyd.
