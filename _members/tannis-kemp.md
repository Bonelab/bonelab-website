I study the way bone adapts to its mechanical and physiological environments. 
I am developing a tool that uses high resolution CT images to predict how bone 
microstructure adapts over time. I am interested in using fundamental engineering 
principles in a biomedical context to develop better medical technologies that improve health outcomes.
Her thesis is titled "An Inverse Interface Evolution Problem to Identify 
Participant-Specific Bone Microarchitecture Adaptation".
In 2021 Tannis started working for Synaptive Medical (https://www.synaptivemedical.com) 
and in 2023 started working for RetiSpec (https://www.retispec.com).
