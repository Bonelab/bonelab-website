Dr. Hanley is Professor Emeritus in the Department of Medicine (Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism) 
in the Cumming School of Medicine at the University of Calgary, with cross appointments in Oncology and 
Community Health Sciences. He was Head of the Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism from 1993-2004, 
and was the founding Medical Director of the Calgary Health Zone’s Osteoporosis and Metabolic Bone Disease 
Centre (now the Dr. David Hanley Osteoporosis Centre). Dr. Hanley is a past chair of Osteoporosis Canada’s 
Scientific Advisory Council, and a past president of the Canadian Society of Endocrinology and Metabolism. 
He served as a member of the Core Committee for the provincial Strategic Clinical Network in Bone 
and Joint Health, and its subcommittee for Fracture Liaison Services.

His laboratory research interests focused upon regulation of calcium metabolism, particularly related to 
Parathyroid Hormone synthesis and secretion. Clinical research interests include calcium and vitamin D nutrition, 
epidemiology of osteoporosis, and clinical trials of therapies related to metabolic bone disease. Since 
retirement in 2015, he has continued involvement in collaborative research with Dr. Steven Boyd in the McCaig 
Institute for Bone and Joint Health evaluating bone imaging related to osteoporosis, and the completion of 
a randomized clinical trial examining the effects of high dose vitamin D on bone strength and density.
