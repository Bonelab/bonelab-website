## Webpage Updates
Any lab member can make changes to the web site by creating a branch. Pull requests to merge to the 
`main` branch are approved by the site administrator.

If you simply want to request a change (add a photo, update a member profile, etc.), [send an email](mailto:bonelab@ucalgary.ca).

Create a branch and clone the repository to your computer. Download, install and run [Docker](https://www.docker.com). 
Navigate to the base directory of your local copy of the repo and get things running:
```
$ cd bonelab-website
$ ./.docker/run.sh
```
Itâ€™ll process the site and then give you the URL to put in your browser:
```
http://localhost:4000
```
Edit your local repo files and whenever you save a file your local web browser will be updated. When you're done, push your updates to GitHub to update the site online.

If you've edited files (e.g., _cite/.cache/cache.db) you may need to restore from the master branch before pushing: 
```
git restore _cite/.cache/cache.db
```
## Common Updates
Here are some tips for simple updates.

### Post a new idea for a project
A new [idea]("ideas") can be added by simply creating a new file in `_posts/` such as `2024-08-19-vertebral-fractures.md`.

### Members
Each member file is stored in `_members`. See other files for examples or refer to `template.txt` in that 
directory. Update your profile, such as personal links (e.g., Email, Instagram, LinkedIn, PubMed, etc) or your biography as you please.

Adding a new member is as simple as creating a new member file in `_members`. 

Profile photos should be 600px X 600px and are stored in `images/headshots` using the naming format `FirstnameLastname.png`.

All changes to `_members` are reflected on the web page upon pushing to GitHub and merging.

### Citations
Citations are based on the ORCID ID of Dr. Steven Boyd. If you see a missing citation you can edit `_data/sources.yaml` and identify
the missing publication by DOI. If you want to associate an image with a particular citation, that is defined in the same file. 
Typically a copy of the first page of the journal publication is a good image to use, and these are stored in `images/journal/`.
