<p>This project is aimed at supporting the concepts of Open Science. We have accrued numerous
datasets in the Bone Imaging Laboratory that would be valuable to the general scientific 
community. Although the process of making data available via Open Science, there are several
challenges that need to be resolved. This include aspects such as (a) ensuring anonymity of the
data, (b) consent to share the data, (c) establishing a place to share the data (i.e., Zenodo),
(d) formatting the data and meta-data such that it follows a standard (i.e., BIDS) by implementing
new MIDS (linked at https://www.ormir.org), (e) setting up permissions for sharing, (f) instructions
on how to cite the data (i.e., https://zenodo.org and/or https://www.nature.com/sdata/). I’m sure
there are many other considerations.</p>

<p>We could explore this process by using a complex dataset such as the Vitamin D study, which includes
HR-pQCT, DXA, biomarker, etc. Or we could start with a simpler dataset, such as ARTININ, which
includes only clinical CT data.</p>]]></content><author><name>Steven Boyd</name></author><category term="hr-pqct" /><category term="clinical CT" /><category term="mri" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Taking the leap to making large datasets available for Open Science…]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://bonelab.ca/images/projects/openscienceideas.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://bonelab.ca/images/projects/openscienceideas.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Improved image segmentation of bone by image filtering</title><link href="https://bonelab.ca/2024/10/06/improving-trabecular-segmentation-by-image-filtering.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Improved image segmentation of bone by image filtering" /><published>2024-10-06T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-10-30T00:25:53+00:00</updated><id>https://bonelab.ca/2024/10/06/improving-trabecular-segmentation-by-image-filtering</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://bonelab.ca/2024/10/06/improving-trabecular-segmentation-by-image-filtering.html"><![CDATA[<p>Can we do a better job of segmenting the trabecular structure in knee scans by HR-pQCT…</p>

<p>The use of HR-pQCT of the knee is relatively new, and although we are able to collect images
as part of our normal protocol now, the size of the knee seems to lead to some beam hardening 
issues at the centre. This is manifested as a slight darking of the trabecular structure. There
is work by the UCSF group (Kazakia, Burghardt) that has shown the so-called Laplace-Hamming
filter provided by Scanco Medical IPL seems to perform better than the standard Gaussian filtering.
Other methods such as Otsu’s method, adaptive filtering, etc, are also options.</p>

<p>The goal of this project is to compare filtering methods on the ability to extract bone 
microarchitecture. We would want to determine how these affect measures such as TbTh and TbSp, 
and possibly finite element outcomes. This could be explored using the TRIKNEE study where we
have three repeat measures on the same individual for a small cohort. The ground-truth would be
taken as the Gauss segmentation, since we don’t have a true gold standard for these in vivo scans.</p>

<p>We know that typically the two main HR-pQCT scanning sites, the radius and tibia, often are 
surrogates for non-weight bearing and weight-bearing mechanical loading, respectively. However,
a complicating factor of the radius is that it is also a site that is prone to motion artifact
during HR-pQCT acquisition. There is research showing that the fibula is not carrying very much
weight relative to the tibia, and since it is scanned in the same FOV as the tibia, it is
subject to exactly the same motion artifacts. Therefore, to determine whether a mechanical 
stimulus, such as microgravity induced bone loss in space flight, it would be possible to 
confirm this difference more clearly because it removes the confounding effect of the motion 
differences between tibia and radius.</p>

<p>It would require going back to the original ISQ files from the TBONE study and extracting the 
fibula from each scan. This would involve a simple modification to the IPL script that gets the
“largest bone” to getting the “second largest bone”. Subsequently, a full morphological analysis
and voxel-based assessment could be performed on the fibula data for direct comparison to the 
tibia.</p>]]></content><author><name>Steven Boyd, with Matthias Walle</name></author><category term="hr-pqct" /><category term="image processing" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Establishing whether the fibula can be a non-weight bearing control instead of distal radius…]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://bonelab.ca/images/projects/TBONE.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://bonelab.ca/images/projects/TBONE.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Extraction of an image mask from polygon data</title><link href="https://bonelab.ca/2024/08/22/masks-from-polygon-data.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Extraction of an image mask from polygon data" /><published>2024-08-22T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-10-30T00:25:53+00:00</updated><id>https://bonelab.ca/2024/08/22/masks-from-polygon-data</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://bonelab.ca/2024/08/22/masks-from-polygon-data.html"><![CDATA[<p>Developing a new method with universal application for defining bone compartments…</p>

<p>Cortical bone mapping with global optimization produces incredible results for all types
of CT data, including clinical CT and HR-pQCT. The result of the algorithm is a polygon
dataset of the periosteal surface of the bone and scalars representing the local thickness
(i.e., periosteal to endosteal) calculated by the algorithm. The calculation of cortical
thickness can be summarized from the individual data points (i.e., means, standard deviations,
localized measurements, etc).</p>

<p>However, the algorithm cannot produce an image mask. So the aim of this project is to develop 
additional functionality that outputs a binarized image with voxels labelled as cortical bone (127), 
trabecular bone (100), and background (0). The image will be the identical size to the input
that is input. Likely it would be based on VTK stencil objects (similar to blRapidPrototype):</p>

<p>When completed it will be validated on HR-pQCT of radius, tibia and knee, as well as QCT of 
abdomen and knee.</p>]]></content><author><name>Steven Boyd</name></author><category term="software" /><category term="image processing" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developing a new method with universal application for defining bone compartments…]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://bonelab.ca/images/projects/Treece.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://bonelab.ca/images/projects/Treece.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Determine the limits of the association between bone mineral density and bone strength</title><link href="https://bonelab.ca/2024/08/20/bmd-to-strength-relationship.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Determine the limits of the association between bone mineral density and bone strength" /><published>2024-08-20T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-10-30T00:25:53+00:00</updated><id>https://bonelab.ca/2024/08/20/bmd-to-strength-relationship</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://bonelab.ca/2024/08/20/bmd-to-strength-relationship.html"><![CDATA[<p>Exploring the relationship between BMD and bone strength: can microarchitecture break the link?</p>

<p>There is a strong relationship between bone mineral density (BMD) and bone strength, however
that relationship breaks down when bone microarchitecture is affected. It is difficult to know
the relative roles of BMD and bone microarchitecture to estimated bone strength. But, with our
TBONE project we have a unique opportunity to find a relationship between BMD and strength
before space flight, immediately upon return to Earth, and a year after recovery. Although BMD
recovers, the bone microarchitecture may be forever altered. We can test that relationship with
this unique dataset.</p>]]></content><author><name>Steven Boyd</name></author><category term="finite elements" /><category term="bone density" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Exploring the relationship between BMD and bone strength: can microarchitecture break the link?]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://bonelab.ca/images/projects/Numerics88.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://bonelab.ca/images/projects/Numerics88.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Opportunistic detection and risk assessment of vertebral fractures in high-risk populations using machine learning</title><link href="https://bonelab.ca/2024/08/19/vertebral-fractures.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Opportunistic detection and risk assessment of vertebral fractures in high-risk populations using machine learning" /><published>2024-08-19T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-10-30T00:25:53+00:00</updated><id>https://bonelab.ca/2024/08/19/vertebral-fractures</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://bonelab.ca/2024/08/19/vertebral-fractures.html"><![CDATA[<p>Training a machine learning model that can identify vertebral fractures in clinical CT scans…</p>

<p>Training a machine learning model that can identify vertebral fractures in clinical CT scans.
This model could either identify the presence of fractures OR identify the fractures and give 
the fracture a grade based on Genant classification. Once the ML model is developed, it could 
be used on RETRO2 to create associations with fracture risk and individuals with various spinal 
conditions (Schmorl’s Nodes, Ankylosing Spondylitis, Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal Hyperostosis, etc.). 
Or could be integrated into the entire opportunistic CT pipeline, since clinicians would be 
interested in finding ways to identify fractures opportunistically.</p>]]></content><author><name>Bryn Matheson</name></author><category term="machine learning" /><category term="clinical ct" /><category term="fracture" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Training a machine learning model that can identify vertebral fractures in clinical CT scans…]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://bonelab.ca/images/projects/Opportunistic.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://bonelab.ca/images/projects/Opportunistic.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
