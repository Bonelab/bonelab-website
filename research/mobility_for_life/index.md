### {% include icon.html icon="fa-solid fa-circle-arrow-right" %}Goal

The goal of the Mobility for Life Project is to form a world-class musculoskeletal health database. Data collected in this database will help researchers identify early indicators of disease, improve diagnosis and target effective treatment.

### {% include icon.html icon="fa-solid fa-circle-arrow-right" %}Recruitment

Researchers hope to recruit thousands of study participants. Because bone and joint conditions take years to develop, we are looking for participants with or without bone and joint conditions to enroll. Participants within the Mobility for Life Project will provide invaluable information to form a comprehensive database. 

Participants must be 18 years or older and reside in Canada.
