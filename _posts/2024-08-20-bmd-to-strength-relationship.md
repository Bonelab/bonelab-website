There is a strong relationship between bone mineral density (BMD) and bone strength, however
that relationship breaks down when bone microarchitecture is affected. It is difficult to know
the relative roles of BMD and bone microarchitecture to estimated bone strength. But, with our
TBONE project we have a unique opportunity to find a relationship between BMD and strength
before space flight, immediately upon return to Earth, and a year after recovery. Although BMD
recovers, the bone microarchitecture may be forever altered. We can test that relationship with
this unique dataset.
