Training a machine learning model that can identify vertebral fractures in clinical CT scans...

 
Training a machine learning model that can identify vertebral fractures in clinical CT scans.
This model could either identify the presence of fractures OR identify the fractures and give 
the fracture a grade based on Genant classification. Once the ML model is developed, it could 
be used on RETRO2 to create associations with fracture risk and individuals with various spinal 
conditions (Schmorlâ€™s Nodes, Ankylosing Spondylitis, Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal Hyperostosis, etc.). 
Or could be integrated into the entire opportunistic CT pipeline, since clinicians would be 
interested in finding ways to identify fractures opportunistically.
