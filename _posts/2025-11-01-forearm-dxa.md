What is the contribution of a forearm DXA to an osteoporosis diagnosis?

A dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) exam typically focuses on the bone mineral density (BMD) of the femoral neck and
the lumbar spine for a diagnosis of osteoporosis. Less frequently, a forearm DXA scan is performed and may contribute
to the diagnosis. 

This project would leverage our Calgary Bone Health Study database of over 2000 participants who have received DXA
exams of their hips, spine and forearm. It would examine how a DXA report of the forearm contributes to the overall
clinical exam. There is an opportunity to compare these findings to our advanced imaging outcomes based on high-resolution
peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) that uses our fracture prediction model, µFRAC, to estimate
fracture risk.

We would use both the 33% and ultradistal forearm DXA sites. The ultradistal corresponds to the HR-pQCT scan site roughly
and the 33% site is what is used clinically.
