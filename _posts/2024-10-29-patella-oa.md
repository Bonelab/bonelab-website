Can we see signs of osteoarthritis in the patella? 

Post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) is a common long-term consequence of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries. The prevalence of patellofemoral joint (PFJ) osteoarthritis (OA) after ACL injury varies widely across studies. Historically, more attention has been given to the tibiofemoral joint due to its primary role in weight-bearing and the more obvious biomechanical changes post-ACL injury. Patellofemoral OA can be more difficult to diagnose and quantify, especially in the early stages, compared to tibiofemoral OA.

This project proposes to investigate the development and progression of PFJ OA by examining changes in bone microarchitecture in the patella following ACL injuries. Specifically, it focuses on characterizing alterations in the microstructural properties of subchondral bone post-ACL injury and assessing the relationship between these bone changes and OA progression over time.
