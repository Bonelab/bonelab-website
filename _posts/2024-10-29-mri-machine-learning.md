Training machine learning models for the extraction of several features from different MRI sequences...


From PD sequences, we can detect/extract bone, cartilage, and meniscus tears.
From T2 sequences, we can detect/extract bone, bone marrow lesions (BMLs), and cartilage. This project
would build on our previous work:

_Stirling CE, Neeteson NJ, Walker REA, Boyd SK, 2024. Deep learning-based automated detection and segmentation of bone and traumatic bone marrow lesions from MRI following an acute ACL tear. Computers in Biology and Medicine 178, 108791._

A model to segment the meniscus could be developed and then compared to our surgical reports from the 
SALTAC and SALTACII studies.
