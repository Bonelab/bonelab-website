Taking the leap to making large datasets available for Open Science...

This project is aimed at supporting the concepts of Open Science. We have accrued numerous
datasets in the Bone Imaging Laboratory that would be valuable to the general scientific 
community. Although the process of making data available via Open Science, there are several
challenges that need to be resolved. This include aspects such as (a) ensuring anonymity of the
data, (b) consent to share the data, (c) establishing a place to share the data (i.e., Zenodo),
(d) formatting the data and meta-data such that it follows a standard (i.e., BIDS) by implementing
new MIDS (linked at https://www.ormir.org), (e) setting up permissions for sharing, (f) instructions
on how to cite the data (i.e., https://zenodo.org and/or https://www.nature.com/sdata/). I'm sure
there are many other considerations.

We could explore this process by using a complex dataset such as the Vitamin D study, which includes
HR-pQCT, DXA, biomarker, etc. Or we could start with a simpler dataset, such as ARTININ, which
includes only clinical CT data.
